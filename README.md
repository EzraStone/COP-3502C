## Projects

### Project 1

For this first assignment, I was asked to implement a program in C that efficiently manages seat reservations in a theater. The assignment requires dynamic memory allocation and manipulation of structs to handle various actions, including purchasing seats and looking up seat ownership. I was tasked with writing various different functions, including but not limited to creating, adding, and looking up orders. A large emphasis is placed on memory management, function implementation, and adherence to runtime requirements.
